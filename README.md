Quick MRI is a web application that allows users to upload knee MRIs and receive a quick "diagnosis".

The application utilizes a convolutional neural network trained using images from the MRNet dataset to classify images as either torn ACLs or healthy ACLS.

This is not a substitution for a medical diagnosis.
